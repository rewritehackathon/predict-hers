**src/MarshRewrite**
This is the folder where the code for all the algorithms that were used have been uploaded along with the email and sms notification python files.

**src**
This folder consists of the website that we will be using on our side. This gives us all the information about:
How well the algorithms are working and highlights which company needs the immediate attention.
The variation of each gaseous hazard as a graph.
SMS and Email notifications are sent as soon as the components cross the hazard levels.

**chatbot**
This automates the underwriting process that Marsh is currently doing manually.
bot.html is the main executable file and index.js and style.css are supporting files.

**How to run**
Run on python3, Hackathon.py.
It automatically runs another python script automaticEmail.py and Send_sms.py and Web.py
